# üí´ About Me:
ü§îCurrently brushing up my skills in Web Development<br>I'm currently taking CS 484: Secure Web App Development, where I‚Äôm diving deep into HTTP, starting from its early days to HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3, understanding how these protocols impact web performance and security. We‚Äôre also focusing on JavaScript and React for frontend development, with an emphasis on key optimization techniques such as bundling, minification, and tree-shaking. This course is designed to equip me with the skills needed to build high-performance, secure web applications, and defend them against real-world attacks using modern web development practices and security protocols.<br><br>üå±Apart from that, I'm a full-time student at University of Illinois at Chicago,<br>pursuing my Masters Of Science in Computer Science!<br><br>üî≠ Things I am currently working on in my past-time - grinding Leetcode (ughhh) and building a simple, <br>personal website which will help me learn more about <br> frontend dev.<br><br>üí¨ Side-note, I also am quite skilled at Data Science and Machine Learning,<br>but most of my projects live in Colab, so I want to learn to get them in-front<br>of the user.<br><br>‚ö°Fun-fact:  I've built a simple interpreter in Ruby and C++ as part of my coursework<br>which helped me learn about the nuances of each of the two languages<br>and how language designers think when building a language! (Watching <br>The PrimeAgen has also helped lol)
